                                                        SMART TRASH BIN


Emerging Technologies of IoT are transforming slowly with Cities administration. As cities will generate waste at an alarming rate which needs collection of waste in smarter way, this collection of waste must be within time and trip planning should be done in real time, based on the status of waste. Earlier efforts were on collection of waste with smart bins but garbage collection to these places and plan trip in an optimal path and odour is not much considered. In this proposed IoT technology with management of waste, odour and trip management in cities is done, so that air pollution can be reduced along with optimized path for waste collection.

At the front end we use XML, C, Java, android and Backend PHP, MySQL are used. The different hardware components used in this project are Arduino microcontroller, Ultrasonic Sensor, MQ136. Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs. Ultrasonic sensing is one of the best ways to sense proximity and detect levels of high reliability. MQ136 is used to detect the foul smell in the garbage.

Firstly, getting familiarize with hardware components. Testing the hardware in different situations. Coding the hardware components. The hardware components are connected to device for passing and relaying information among them. Sensor helps to know the level of garbage at maximum level, Micro- controller acts has interface between sensor and GSM system.

Secondly, the data which is given as input and output are stored in the server. At sever end all information is stored on to database. Coding the information using MQTT protocol for storing and retrieving information from the server. Calculate the percentage filled data. The data is sent with the help of GSM shield in form of Short Message Service (SMS) and this information is stored in the database at the server side.

Thirdly, alert message creation and android app development for viewing the status of the bin and odour level.
