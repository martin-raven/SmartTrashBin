                                                        SMART TRASH BIN


Emerging Technologies of IoT are transforming slowly with Cities administration. As cities will generate waste at an alarming rate which needs collection of waste in smarter way, this collection of waste must be within time and trip planning should be done in real time, based on the status of waste. Earlier efforts were on collection of waste with smart bins but garbage collection to these places and plan trip in an optimal path and odour is not much considered. In this proposed IoT technology with management of waste, odour and trip management in cities is done, so that air pollution can be reduced along with optimized path for waste collection.

At the front end we use XML, C, Java, android and Backend PHP, MySQL are used. The different hardware components used in this project are Node MCU, Ultrasonic Sensor, MQ136. NodeMCU is an open source IoT platform. NodeMCU means a firmware rather than a development platform.NodeMCU controls the data traffic between the sensors and the firebase. It consists of analog and digital I/O
pins that communicate with the HCSR04 and MQ136. It is a microcontroller Unit based on the 12E version of the Esp-8266. Ultrasonic sensing is one of the best ways to sense proximity and detect levels of high reliability. MQ136 is used to detect the foul smell in the garbage.
